Our application with custom versions designed for all devices first came out for the Android platform, but now iOS version is also developed. If iTube is the iOS version of apk, first we publish it as the official site of the application. It is completely free. The biggest problem with devices that use iOS operating system like iPhone is to download videos and music. It does not allow you to download any content because it is an overly secure system. But now with our application you can download the content you want on the internet to your phone and you can open and use it without needing the internete whenever you want.
